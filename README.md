Manage multiple Minecraft server instances with a simple, powerful GUI

## Description

A very scuffed and WIP project, inspired by [MultiMC](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher), that allows you to manage multiple local Minecraft servers.<br>
Create a server, choose a server software and version, and manage it from the app.<br>
Create profiles as preconfigured servers to get a server up and running quicker!
